// Visibility in C++: no direct impact on performance, but helps in organizing code and providing access control
// Three types of visibility: private, protected, and public
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#define Log(x) std::cout << x << std::endl;

struct sRobot { // In struct, default visibility is public
    int x, y; // Public by default
};

class Robot { // In class, default visibility is private
private: // Private members can only be accessed within this class
    int X, Y;
    void Print() {}  // Private methods can only be called from within the class

protected: // Protected members can be accessed by this class and its subclasses
    int pX, pY;

public:

        X = 2; 
        Y = 1;

    }

class NameRobot : public Robot {

    NameRobot* nr = new NameRobot();
    // nr->pX = 10;  // Error: Can't access protected members from outside the class

    // Visibility is used for better code readability and maintenance.
    // It signals the developer about how to interact with the class and its members.
    // CPUs and compilers don't understand "private" or "protected"â€”these are purely for code organization and access control.
